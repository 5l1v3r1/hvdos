# hvdos

*hvdos* is a simple DOS emulator based on the OS X 10.10 Yosemite Hypervisor.framework.

## Purpose

Consider this project more of an example or a template to create solutions based on Hypervisor.framework than a useful application on its own.

## Status

*hvdos* can run some simple DOS programs in .COM format. Try [PKUNZJR.COM](https://github.com/libcpu/libcpu/blob/2fa4a9574a3320bd3953d1b238c36f55090405fb/test/bin/x86/pkunzjr.com?raw=true) for example.

## License

See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) (2-clause-BSD).

In order to simplify use of this code as a template, you can consider any parts from "hvdos.c" and "interface.h" as being in the public domain.
